        Determines the path to access the related Project from this model.

        This method returns the appropriate accessor path based on the model's relationship to Project:

        1. For direct ForeignKey or OneToOneField relationships to Project (occurrence.project)
            - Returns "project" automatically (no need to define project_accessor)

        2. For ManyToMany relationships to Project (pipeline.projects)
            - Returns "projects" automatically (no need to define project_accessor)
            - Note: Draft filtering will return objects with at least one non-draft project
            - This is appropriate for global objects (pipelines, taxa, etc.) that can belong to multiple projects
            - Such objects are never private data, unlike project-specific objects (occurrences, source_images)

        3. For indirect relationships (accessed through other models) (detection.occurrence.project):
            - Requires explicitly defining a 'project_accessor' class attribute
            - Uses the Django double underscore convention ("__") to navigate through relationships
            - Example: "deployment__project" (not "deployment.project")
                where "deployment" is a field on this model and "project" is a field on Deployment

        4. For the Project model itself:
            - No project_accessor needed; will be handled by the isinstance check in get_project()

        Returns:
            str|None: The path to the related project, or None for no relationship or the Project model itself.
