# Docker Compose Override File for Local Development
#
# This file can be used to enable debugging and other local development features (db volume location, etc.)
# without affecting the committed docker-compose.yml file.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file: cp docker-compose.override-example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
# 2. Start services: docker compose up
# 3. Attach debugger from VS Code using the launch configurations in .vscode/launch.json
#
# The docker-compose.override.yml file is git-ignored for local customization.
