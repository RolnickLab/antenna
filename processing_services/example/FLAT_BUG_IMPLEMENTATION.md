# Flat-Bug Integration Implementation

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the `FlatBugObjectDetector` class to use the actual flat-bug library instead of relying on a Hugging Face checkpoint. Here's what was changed and how it works:

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `compile()` method
- **Before**: Used `transformers.pipeline` with a placeholder checkpoint
- **After**: Uses `flat_bug.predictor.Predictor` with the default model `'flat_bug_M.pt'`
- The model will be automatically downloaded on first use
- Added configurable hyperparameters (score threshold, IoU threshold, etc.)

### 2. Updated `run()` method
- **Before**: Called `self.model(image, candidate_labels=...)`
- **After**: Uses `self.model.pyramid_predictions(image)` which is the flat-bug API
- Handles the `TensorPredictions` response format from flat-bug
- Converts tensors to numpy arrays and extracts bounding boxes and scores

### 3. Updated description
- Now accurately reflects that it uses the actual flat-bug library
- Mentions specialization for terrestrial arthropod detection

## How It Works

1. **Installation**: Flat-bug needs to be installed from source:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darsa-group/flat-bug.git
   cd flat-bug
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Model Loading**: The `flat_bug_M.pt` model is downloaded automatically on first use

3. **Inference**: Uses flat-bug's pyramid tiling approach for detection on arbitrarily large images

4. **Output**: Converts flat-bug's `TensorPredictions` format to your existing `Detection` objects

## Installation Requirements

```bash
# Install flat-bug
pip install git+https://github.com/darsa-group/flat-bug.git

# Ensure PyTorch is installed
pip install torch>=2.3
```

## Testing

I've created `test_flat_bug_implementation.py` which you can run to:
- Verify the flat-bug installation
- Inspect the actual format of `TensorPredictions` objects
- Confirm the attribute names and data structures

## Potential Adjustments Needed

The implementation makes some assumptions about the flat-bug API that should be verified:

1. **Attribute names**: I assumed `predictions.boxes` and `predictions.scores` exist, but these might be named differently
2. **Box format**: I assumed boxes are in `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` format, but this should be confirmed
3. **Tensor handling**: The conversion from tensors to numpy arrays might need adjustment

## Running the Test

```bash
cd /Users/markfisher/Desktop/antenna/processing_services/example/
python test_flat_bug_implementation.py
```

This will show you the exact structure of the `TensorPredictions` object and help identify any needed adjustments.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No checkpoint URL needed**: Uses the official flat-bug library with built-in model management
2. **Specialized for arthropods**: Flat-bug is specifically trained for terrestrial arthropod detection
3. **High performance**: Uses pyramid tiling for efficient processing of large images
4. **Automatic model download**: No need to manually manage model files
5. **Configurable**: Can adjust detection thresholds and other hyperparameters

The implementation should work as-is, but running the test script will help identify any format discrepancies that need minor adjustments.
